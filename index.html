                        <h2> cats vs dogs image classification </h2>
                <p>This  project utilizes Python with TensorFlow and Keras frameworks to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the Dogs vs Cats dataset from Kaggle.
                 The main agenda is to classify images of dogs and cats. It starts by downloading and extracting the dataset, then prepares training and validation datasets using image_dataset_from_directory.
                 The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers with batch normalization, max pooling, and dense layers with dropout for regularization. It uses the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss for compilation. The training results are plotted for accuracy and loss on both training and validation sets over 10 epochs. To reduce overfitting, techniques like dropout and batch normalization are employed.
                  Finally, it includes code to load a test image, preprocess it, and make a prediction using the trained model.
                  Unique thing about this project is its focus on classifying images of dogs and cats using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with TensorFlow and Keras frameworks.

                        <h2> Movie recommender system </h2>
                        <p>This project  utilizes Python with several key frameworks and technologies for data manipulation and recommendation systems.
                         It leverages pandas for data handling, scikit-learn for machine learning operations including cosine similarity computation, and Streamlit for creating an interactive web application.
                          The goal of this code is to recommend movies based on textual data analysis (synopsis, genres, keywords, cast, and crew). It preprocesses movie metadata from TMDB,
                           applies natural language processing techniques like CountVectorizer for text feature extraction, computes similarity between movies using cosine similarity,
                            and then recommends similar movies based on user input.
                             This approach is unique in combining text-based similarity with movie metadata to provide personalized movie recommendations.

                        <h2> Fruit vegetable recognition </h2>
                        <p>This project utilizes Python as the primary programming language along with TensorFlow and Keras frameworks for building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
                         Streamlit is employed as the server framework to facilitate image predictions based on the dataset.
                          The main agenda of the project is to classify images of fruits and vegetables. It begins by preprocessing the training, validation, and test datasets using TensorFlow's image_dataset_from_directory function.
                         The CNN architecture includes convolutional layers, max pooling, dropout for regularization, and dense layers for classification.
                          The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. Unique to this project is its integration with Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time image predictions. Users can upload images of fruits or vegetables, and the model predicts the type of produce depicted in the image with high accuracy.
                         This interactive and accessible approach distinguishes it from traditional image recognition projects, enhancing user engagement and practical usability.
